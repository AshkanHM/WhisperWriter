# **App Name**: WhisperWriter

## Core Features:

- Real-time Transcription: Utilize the OpenAI Whisper API for real-time voice recognition.
- Clipboard Integration: Capture the transcribed text and copy it to the clipboard.
- Global Hotkey Activation: Allow the user to begin voice recording with a system-wide hotkey, whether or not the WhisperWriter window is currently in focus.
- Language selection: Allow the user to configure the recording language in the UI
- AI-Powered Text Formatting: Overlay widget that allows the user to right-click and set the desired text output style (e.g., 'friendly WhatsApp chat,' 'professional email'). Sends the transcript to the ChatGPT 4.0 mini API to rewrite based on the selected prompt and then pastes the rewritten text.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dark and black with some gray in it to evoke a sense of calm and focus.
- Light gray (#F5F5F5) to reduce eye strain during extended use.
- Blue (#000000) for a subtle and contrasting highlight on active UI elements.
- Clean and highly readable sans-serif font for both the UI and the transcribed text display.
- Simple and recognizable icons for record/pause/stop actions.
- Minimalist and intuitive layout for ease of use. Centralized display of transcribed text with clearly defined control buttons.
